# Aspnetcore test suite

## Unit tests 

The unit tests list - unit-tests-w-testhost was generated by enumerating the directories under aspnetcore/artifacts/bin/ which have testhost.dll present.

`
find appdir -type f -name testhost.dll | grep -v "Functional" | grep -v "Integration" >> unit-tests-w-testhost
`

The subset of these tests passing on Linux are in `unit-tests.all`.
The subset passing on Mystikos are in `unit-tests.passed`.
