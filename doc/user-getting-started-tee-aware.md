# Getting started with a TEE-aware program

Please see [README](../README.md) for how to install Mystikos or build
it from source code.

This document guides users to create TEE-aware applications, which are
essential to many confidential computing scenarios.

## The problem statement

Why would an application want to be aware of the TEE it's running within? Two
possible requirements are:

* In an **isolated confidential computing** scenario, the application should
  behave differently based on whether it's running
  inside a TEE or not, and, if it is, which types of TEE;
* In a **collaborated confidential computing** scenario, the application wants
  to get help from the TEE, and gain trust to obtain secrets from an external
  party which enforces a policy such as only releasing keys to applications
  running inside a TEE with certain identities.

Why is **collaborated confidential computing** so important?
Imagine a doomsday scenario when the digital world has fallen: all routers/NICs
on the internet and all operating systems become untrustworthy, the
**collaborated confidential computing** would enable a group of
applications, serving as `safe harbors`, to collaborate and fight against
the malicious world.

## Mystikos solution

Mystikos provides two environment variables, `MYST_TARGET` and
`MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS`, for TEE aware applications.

`MYST_TARGET` is read only, and applications can query the variable to
find out whether it is running outside or inside a TEE, and, when it's
running inside a TEE, which specific TEE platform it is.

When applications set `MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS` to `CERT_PEMKEY`, the Mystikos
runtime, as part of the booting process, will generate:

* a self-signed TLS certificate with root of trust from the
TEE; and
* an ephemeral private key corresponding to the public key embedded
in the certificate.

Both credentials are then saved to a fixed location in the file system.
Note the private key is exported in PEM format.
With both the certificate and the private key, the application can establish
an attested TLS channel with a peer, as long as the peer could perform
verification on the certificate and relate it to the root of trust from
the TEE. Now both parties can exchange secrets without the fear of
eavesdropping from malicious actors on the internet.

Furthermore, Mystikos provides two system calls, one for generating the above
mentioned certificate and private key, one for verifying the certificate,
for languages that support direct invocation of syscalls, such as C/C++.
These syscalls give application the flexibility to generate or verify as
many TLS certificates as possible at any time, without relying on
`MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS`.

For applications written in high level languages which allow no direct
syscalls, FFI can be used to call into a native library that exposes such
system calls.

## Write a program that behaves differently for TEE and non-TEE

This example shows how to write a program that potentially performs secret
operations only when running inside a TEE.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    const char* target = getenv("MYST_TARGET");
    if ( !target )
    {
       printf("I am in unknown environment\n");
       return 1;
    }
    if (strcmp(target, "sgx") != 0)
    {
        printf("I am in non-TEE\n");\
        return 1;
    }

    printf("I am in SGX!  Now, for secrets!\n");
    // Perform secret operations below
    // ...

    return 0;
}
```

Save this to `tee.c`. You can build and run the program on Ubuntu with the
following commands:

```bash
gcc tee.c -o tee && ./tee
```
The output should be: `I am in unknown environment`.

Now build and run the program in SGX with the following commands:
```bash
mkdir appdir; myst-gcc tee.c -o appdir/tee
myst mkcpio appdir rootfs && myst exec rootfs /tee
```

The output should be: `I am in SGX`.

## Write a program that generates/verifies self-signed certificates programmatically

This example shows how to generate TLS certificate and verify it using
system calls with C/C++. This is not interesting by itself because there
is no peers to establish trust with. For a peer-to-peer trusted channel
example, please check
[solutions attested_tls](https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos/tree/main/solutions/attested_tls).

A self-signed certificates generated by Mystikos includes:

* A public key for subsequent encrypted communications, and
* An attestation report containing:
    * The prove that the application is running in a specific TEE;
    * The application's identity; and
    * The hash of the communication public key.

When running with Mystikos, a application verifies the self-signed certificate
from a peer by issuing a syscall to Mystikos that:

1. extracts the public key and the attestation report;
1. checks if the attestation report is genuinely generated by a TEE;
1. checks if the hash of the public key matches the hash value inside
the attestation report;
1. checks if the application identity is expected. See `_verifier`
function below as an example.

```c
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <myst/tee.h>

int _verifier(myst_tee_identity_t* identity, void* ptr)
{
    // Expected Product ID: {1}
    const uint8_t PRODID[MYST_PRODUCT_ID_SIZE] = {1};
    // Expected security version: 1
    const int SVN = 1;

    // Returning 0 means pass.
    // We can easily expand this to more sophicated checks
    // based on unique_id, signer_id, etc.
    return memcmp(identity->product_id, PRODID, MYST_PRODUCT_ID_SIZE) ||
           identity->security_version != SVN;
}

int main()
{
    long ret;
    /* Extended syscalls */
    const long SYS_myst_gen_creds = 1009;
    const long SYS_myst_free_creds = 1010;
    const long SYS_myst_verify_cert = 1011;
    void* cert = NULL;
    void* pkey = NULL;
    size_t cert_size = 0, pkey_size = 0;

    ret = syscall(SYS_myst_gen_creds, &cert, &cert_size, &pkey, &pkey_size);
    assert(ret == 0);
    printf("Generated self-signed certificate and private key\n");

    ret = syscall(SYS_myst_verify_cert, cert, cert_size, _verifier, NULL);
    assert(ret == 0);
    printf("Verified self-signed certificate\n");

    ret = syscall(SYS_myst_free_creds, cert, cert_size, pkey, pkey_size);
    assert(ret == 0);

    return 0;
}
```

Save the file as `tee2.c`. Now build and run the program in SGX with the
following commands:
```bash
myst-gcc tee2.c -I/opt/mystikos/include -o appdir/tee2
myst mkcpio appdir rootfs && myst exec rootfs /tee2
```
And the output should be:
```
Generated self-signed certificate and private key
Verified self-signed certificate
```

The application is free to provide `NULL` for the third parameter of
`SYS_myst_verify_cert`. In that case, Mystikos would accept any
application running inside a TEE with no regard to the application identity.

If the application does want to reject/approve based on app identity, it
must include `myst/tee.h`, define a function similar to `_verifier`,
and pass it to syscall `SYS_myst_verify_cert`.

## Write a C# program that obtains attestation credentials statically

High level languages like C# don't have direct access to syscalls as
C/C++ do. Therefore, we introduce the environment variable
`MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS`, which when specified in `config.json`, instructs
Mystikos to generate desired credentials and save them on the file system
for applications to make use of.

First we declare the desire in the config.json:
```json
{
    // OpenEnclave specific values

    // Whether we are running myst+OE+app in debug mode
    "Debug": 1,
    // The number of ethreads
    "NumUserThreads": 32,
    "ProductID": 1,
    "SecurityVersion": 1,

    // Mystikos specific values

    // The heap size of the user application. Increase this setting if your app experienced OOM.
    "MemorySize": "1g",
    // The path to the entry point application in rootfs
    "ApplicationPath": "/app/HelloWorld",
    // The parameters to the entry point application
    "ApplicationParameters": [],
    // Whether we allow "ApplicationParameters" to be overridden by command line options of "myst exec"
    "HostApplicationParameters": false,
    // The environment variables accessible inside the enclave.
    "EnvironmentVariables": ["COMPlus_EnableDiagnostics=0", "MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS=CERT_PEMKEY_REPORT"],
}
```

Note the last line `MYST_WANT_TEE_CREDENTIALS=CERT_PEMKEY_REPORT` tells
Mystikos to generate three files for the application:
1. a self-signed x509
certificate with an ephemeral RSA public key
1. a private RSA key (in PEM format) that is paired with the public key
1. a TEE-backed report that attests to the public key (by including the
hash of the public key in the signed report)

The application can then load these credentials in the following manner:

```c#
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;

namespace dotnet
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            string certFile = "/tmp/myst.crt";
            string pkeyFile = "/tmp/myst.key";
            string reportFile = "/tmp/myst.report";

            // Load the certificate into an X509Certificate object.
            X509Certificate2 cert = new X509Certificate2(File.ReadAllBytes(certFile));
            Console.WriteLine("Subject: {0}", cert.Subject);

            Console.WriteLine("Public key: {0}", cert.GetPublicKeyString());

            byte[] report = File.ReadAllBytes(reportFile);
            Console.Write("Report: ");
            foreach(byte b in report)
            {
                Console.Write("{0:X2}", b);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();

            string pem = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(pkeyFile);
            const string header = "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----";
            const string footer = "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----";

            if (pem.StartsWith(header))
            {
                // The private key file is in PEM format. Read and parse the DER structure.
                int endIdx = pem.IndexOf(footer, header.Length, StringComparison.Ordinal);
                string base64 = pem.Substring(header.Length, endIdx - header.Length);
                byte[] der = Convert.FromBase64String(base64);

                // Import the private key into the cert.
                RSA rsa = RSA.Create();
                rsa.ImportRSAPrivateKey(der, out _);
                cert = cert.CopyWithPrivateKey(rsa);
                Console.WriteLine("Imported RSA private key into cert");
            }

            // At this moment, the application can send the certificate and
            // the report to peers. The peer could validate the public key in
            // the certificate as long as it has access to an attestation
            // service like MAA.
        }
    }
}
```
