# 1) PyTorch is not officially supported on Alpine.
# See https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/compiling-master-from-source-on-alpine-fails-with-undefined-reference-to-backtrace/64676.
# By defining __EMSCRIPTEN__ the build disables certain features like backtrace support.
# This is a work-around.

# 2) Using OpenBLAS caused a segfault. Not installing libopenblas-dev causes PyTorch
# to fall-back to Eigen. Setting BLAS=Eigen does not work due to a bug in the CMake
# script.

# 3) By default, PyTorch uses OpenMP, however due to https://github.com/lsds/sgx-lkl-oe/issues/264
# we need to disable that. Using USE_OPENMP=0 is broken as PyTorch still uses OMP symbols
# but now doesn't link against OpenMP, caused symbol errors.
# Adding ATEN_THREADING=NATIVE and USE_MKLDNN=0 seems to work around the issue.
