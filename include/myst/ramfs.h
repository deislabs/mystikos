/* Virtual files in ramfs

Loosely defined a virtual file is one whose contents
are generated on-the-fly.

ramfs supports two types of virtual files:
- OPEN: files whose contents are generated at open()
    Useful where the file contents can be populated once.
    `myst_file_t.vbuf` field is used to store the buffer. Instead of the inode
    buffer, the file level buffer was used to ensure some protection against
    concurrent access.
    Subsequent reads and writes are serviced from the populated buffer.
    The buffer is released on close().


- RW: files for which read and write operations are stateless.
    Useful where the file is unbounded, or has special behavior on
    reads and writes.
    Read and write file operations on these files operate directly
    on the user provided buffer.
