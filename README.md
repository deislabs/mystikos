# Mystikos

**Mystikos** is a set of tools for running applications in a hardware trusted
execution environment (TEE). The current release supports **Intel &reg; SGX**
while other TEEs may be supported in future releases. **Linux** is also a
supported target, though only suitable for testing purposes as it provides
no additional protection.

## Goals

- Enable protection of application code and data while in memory through the
  use of HW TEEs. This should be combined with proper key management,
  attestation and hardware roots of trust, and encryption of data at rest and
  in transit to protect against other threats which are out of scope for this
  project.
- Lift and shift applications, either native or containerized, into TEEs with
  little or no modification.
- Allow users and application developers control over the makeup of the trusted
  computing base (TCB), ensuring that all components running inside the TEE are
  open source.
- Simplify re-targeting to other TEE architectures through a plugin
  architecture.

## Architecture

**Mystikos** consists of the following components:
- a C-runtime based on [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org)
- a "lib-os like" kernel
- the kernel-target interface (TCALL)
- a command-line interface
- some related utilities

Today, two target implementations are provided:
- The **SGX** target (based on the [Open Enclave
  SDK](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave))
- The **Linux** target (for verification on non-SGX platforms)

The minimalist kernel of Mystikos manages essential computing resources
inside the TEE, such as CPU/threads, memory, files, networks, etc. It handles
most of the syscalls that a normal operating system would handle (with
[limits](doc/syscall-limitations.md)).  Many syscalls are handled directly by the
kernel while others are delegated to the target.

# Installation Guide

## Verify the Intel SGX DCAP Driver is Installed

Some distributions come with the SGX driver already installed; if it is,
you don't need to re-install it. You can verify this by running:

```bash
dmesg | grep -i sgx
```

If the output is blank, install the driver manually by downloading it from Intel.

> NOTE: The script below may not refer to the latest Intel SGX DCAP driver.
> Check [Intel's SGX Downloads page](https://01.org/intel-software-guard-extensions/downloads)
> to see if a more recent SGX DCAP driver exists.

```bash
sudo apt -y install dkms
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.7/linux/distro/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.35.bin -O sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
```
## Add Intel's repository & install the sgx libraries

```bash
echo 'deb [arch=amd64] https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu bionic main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-sgx.list
wget -qO - https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx_repo/ubuntu/intel-sgx-deb.key | sudo apt-key add -

sudo apt update

sudo apt -y install libsgx-enclave-common libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-dcap-ql-dev
```

## Download Mystikos

You can [download the latest build here](https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos/releases)
then simply decompress it, add it to your path, and run it.

```
# change this to match the latest version
LATEST='0.1.2'
RELEASE="mystikos-${LATEST}-x86_64"

# this will create the "mystikos" directory within your current working directory
curl -sSL --ssl https://github.com/deislabs/mystikos/releases/download/v${LATEST}/${RELEASE}.tar.gz | tar -xzf -

# you can use mystikos from your home directory, or any path
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/mystikos/bin"
```

## Install From Source

You may also [build Mystikos from source](BUILDING.md). In our experience, this
takes about 20 minutes. 

**NOTE** that Mystikos can only be built on **Ubuntu 18.04** due to current
limitations in [Open Enclave SDK](https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave).


# Quick Start Docs

Eager to get started with Mystikos? We've prepared a few guides, starting from
a simple "hello world" C program and increasing in complexity, including
demonstrations of DotNet and Python/NumPy.

Give it a try and let us know what you think!

## Simple Applications

- A Simple "Hello World" in C: [click here](doc/user-getting-started-c.md)
- Packaging your "Hello World" app in Docker: [click
  here](doc/user-getting-started-docker-c++.md)
- Introducing Enclave Configuration with a DotNet program: [click
  here](doc/user-getting-started-docker-dotnet.md)
- Running Python & NumPy for complex calculations: [click
  here](doc/user-getting-started-docker-python.md)

## Enclave Aware Applications

Sometimes, you want to take advantage of specific properties of the Trusted
Execution Environment, such as attestation. The following example shows how to
write a C program which changes its behaviour when it detects that it has been
securely launched inside an SGX enclave.

We've got plans for a lot more documentation as the project grows, and we'd
love your feedback and contributions, too.
